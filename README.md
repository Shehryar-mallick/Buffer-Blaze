# Buffer-Overflow
Objective of this assignment was to execute a buffer overflow attack on a vulnerable machine and retrieve the required flag. Using reconnaissance and enumeration techniques. Leveraging the Eternal Blue exploit via Metasploit, gained administrative access and maintained persistence by modifying the password. Utilized a fuzzer to locate the buffer overflow vulnerability and pinpoint the Extended Instruction Pointer (EIP). After calculating the offset, crafted a payload to exploit the vulnerability, successfully gaining control of the system and retrieving the flag.
